# todoey_flutter

This is a starter project that I have created by learning The 2021 Flutter Bootcamp using Dart which was taught by Dr. Angela Yu. 

What this app does is it helps in creating a todo list and delete and check off items from the list. It is a very simple 2 screen app, one for displaying the list of todo items and another one for adding new todo items to the list. Over all it does not use any Firebase datastore or any APIs and stuff, everything is stored locally.

Future plans: Adding a local database using SQLite database management system.

## Getting Started
